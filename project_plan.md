# **Project Plan: NLP | Automated Customer Reviews**

---

## **1. Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to automate the processing of customer reviews by comparing traditional machine learning (ML) methods with a deep learning approach (transformers). Additionally, the project aims to use Generative AI to summarize reviews based on ratings and product categories and to create a visualization dashboard.

---

## **2. Project Scope**
1. **Sentiment Classification:** 
   - Classify reviews as *Positive, Neutral, or Negative* based on text content.
   - Compare **traditional ML methods** (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) with a **transformer-based model** (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT).

2. **Generative AI (Bonus Task):**
   - Summarize reviews per rating (0-5 stars) and top product categories.

3. **Dashboard & Visualization:**
   - Create a **dynamic, interactive dashboard** using Plotly, Tableau, or another visualization tool.

---

## **3. Data Collection**
- **Datasets:**  
  - Amazon customer reviews dataset (downsized for feasibility).
  - Alternative product review datasets if necessary.
- **Preprocessing Rules:**  
  - Convert rating scores:
    - 1, 2, 3 → Negative  
    - 4 → Neutral  
    - 5 → Positive

## **4. Methodology**

### **A. Traditional NLP & ML Approach**
#### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- **Cleaning:** Remove special characters, punctuation, and extra spaces.
- **Tokenization & Lemmatization:** Convert text into individual words and their base forms.
- **Vectorization:** Convert text into numerical features using:
  - CountVectorizer
  - TF-IDF Vectorizer

#### **Step 2: Model Building**
- **Model Selection:**
  - Train models: **Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.**
  - Use **cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning** to optimize.
- **Model Training:** Train selected models using the preprocessed dataset.

#### **Step 3: Model Evaluation**
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Confusion Matrix:** To analyze classification performance.

### **B. Transformer-Based Approach (Hugging Face)**
#### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
- **Cleaning & Tokenization:** Use Hugging Face’s tokenizer to convert text into model-compatible inputs.
- **Encoding:** Convert tokens into numerical IDs.

#### **Step 2: Model Building**
- **Base Model Selection:** Evaluate pre-trained models:
  - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT
- **Baseline Testing:** Evaluate accuracy using the pre-trained model without fine-tuning.

#### **Bonus: Fine-Tuning**
- Train the model on the dataset to adapt it for sentiment classification.
- Optimize batch size, learning rate, and training epochs.

#### **Step 3: Model Evaluation**
- Compare **pre-trained vs. fine-tuned model** performance.
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Confusion Matrix:** For deeper insights.

## **5. Bonus: Generative AI Summarization**
- **Summarization Objective:** Generate review summaries:
  - Grouped by review score (0-5 stars).
  - Grouped by product categories.
- **Approach:** 
  - Use **GPT-based models** (e.g., T5, BART) for summarization.

---

## **6. Dashboard & Visualization**
- **Tool:** Use **Plotly**, Tableau, or other visualization tools.
- **Features:**
  - Sentiment distribution over time.
  - Breakdown of reviews per rating category.
  - Summarized insights for product categories.

---

## **7. Deliverables**
1. **PDF Report:** Documenting the methodology, results, and analysis.
2. **Reproducible Code:** Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts.
3. **PowerPoint Presentation:** Summarizing the findings.
4. **Bonus:** Deploy a web app for real-time querying.
